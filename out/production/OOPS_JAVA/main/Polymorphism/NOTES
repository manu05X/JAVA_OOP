//Compiler will only allow you to use/access the attributes and method that are present in the DATA TYPE of Variable
// and not in the real OBJECT.
// DataType Variable = new DataTypeOfObject()


EX - A
    /  \
   B    C
   A a = new C() // Can not access the attribute of C
   C c = new C() // Can access the attribute of C and A also as it is child of A

   HashMap hm = new HashMap() X not wrong but bad practice
   Map hm = new HashMap() // is correct practice, this is more extensible
   Map hm = new TreeMap()


Compiler : It works on dataType of Variable;
Compiler will only allow you to compile the code if you are accessing the attribute and method as per DATA TYPE of variable.
    As compiler knows only data type of variable.

   When the code runs the Overridden method of child will be called

Runtime : It works on dataType of Object present in the memory during run time.
