Lock Fairness
We'll briefly touch on the topic of fairness in locks since its out of scope for this course. When locks get acquired by threads, there's no guarantee of the order in which threads are granted access to a lock. A thread requesting lock access more frequently may be able to acquire the lock unfairly greater number of times than other locks. Java locks can be turned into fair locks by passing in the fair constructor parameter. However, fair locks exhibit lower throughput and are slower compared to their unfair counterparts.

Thread Pools
Imagine an application that creates threads to undertake short-lived tasks. The application would incur a performance penalty for first creating hundreds of threads and then tearing down the allocated resources for each thread at the ends of its life. The general way programming frameworks solve this problem is by creating a pool of threads, which are handed out to execute each concurrent task and once completed, the thread is returned to the pool

Java offers thread pools via its Executor Framework. The framework includes classes such as the ThreadPoolExecutor for creating thread pools.
