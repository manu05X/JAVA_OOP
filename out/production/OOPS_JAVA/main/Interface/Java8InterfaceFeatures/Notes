- Java8 main.Interface features:
         - Default Method
         ANS: main.Interface can have only Abstract method and all child classes has to provide abstract method implementation
         ________________________
         - Static Method:
            - We can provide the implementation of the method in interface.
            - But it can not be overridden by classes which implement the interface.
            - We can access it using main.Interface name itself.
            - Its by default public.
         __________________________
3. Private Method and Private Static Method Java9
    - ANS: - We can provide the implementation of method but as a private access modifier in interface.
           - It brings more readability of the code. For example if multiple default method share some code, that this can help.
           - It can be defined as static and non-static.
           - From Static method, we can call only private static interface method.
           - Private static method, can be called from both static and non static method.
           - Private interface method can not be abstract. Means we have to provide the definition.
           - It can be used inside of the particular interface only.

Example:
           public interface Bird {
                void canFly(); //this is equivalent to public abstract void canFly();
           }

           public default void minimumFlyingHeight() {
                myStaticPublicMethod(); //calling static method
                myPrivateMethod(); //calling private method
                myPrivateStaticMethod(); //calling private static method
           }

           static void myStaticPublicMethod() {
                myPrivateStaticMethod(); //from static we can call other static method only
           }

           private void myPrivateMethod(){
                //private method implementation

           }

           private static void my PrivateStaticMethod() {
                //private static method implementation

           }
