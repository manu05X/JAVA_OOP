Conclusion
The LSP is an important principle that should be extended to the level of system architecture. A small violation of the substitutability of classes can cause the system to break down, which is why we should always be on the lookout for violations. A few benefits of the LSP are provided below:

It avoids the generalization of concepts that may not be needed in the future.

It makes the code maintainable and easier to upgrade.

Now that we have learned about the Liskov Substitution Principle, let's look at the main.Interface Segregation Principle in the next lesson.
