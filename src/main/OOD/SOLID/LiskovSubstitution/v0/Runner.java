/*
In this example:

The Vehicle class has attributes such as brand, model, year, and speed, along with methods to accelerate and brake.

The Car class is a subclass of Vehicle and has an additional attribute numberOfDoors. It inherits the attributes and methods from the Vehicle class and can have its own specific attributes and methods.

The Main class demonstrates creating instances of both the generic Vehicle class and the specific Car class and performing operations such as accelerating and braking.
