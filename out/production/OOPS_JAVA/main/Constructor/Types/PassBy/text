The two most prevalent modes of passing arguments to methods are “passing-by-value” and “passing-by-reference”.
Different programming languages use these concepts in different ways. As far as Java is concerned,
everything is strictly Pass-by-Value.

We learned that parameter passing in Java is always Pass-by-Value. However, the context changes depending upon whether we’re dealing with Primitives or Objects:

1> For Primitive types, parameters are pass-by-value
2> For Object types, the object reference is pass-by-value
