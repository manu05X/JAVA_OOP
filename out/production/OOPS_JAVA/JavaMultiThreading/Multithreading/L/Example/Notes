CAS-based counter performance
The performance of CAS instruction varies across processors and architectures and though it may seem that a CAS-based counter may perform poorly in comparision to a lock-based counter, the reality is otherwise. In practice CAS-based locks outperform lock-based counters when there is no contention (as the thread doesnâ€™t go through the process of acquiring a lock) and often when there is low to moderate contention. Acquiring a lock usually involves at least one CAS operation and peripheral lock-related housekeeping tasks, which implies more work is done by a lock-based counter in the best case of zero contention compared to a CAS-based counter.
